Ed Sheeran,Take It Back,× (Multiply),2014-06-20,i'm not a rapper i'm a singer with a flow i've got a habit for spitting quicker lyrics you know you'll find me ripping the writtens out of the pages they sit in i never want to get bitten 'cause plagiarism is hidden watch how i sit on the rhythm prisoner with the vision signed to a label but didn't listen to any criticism thought you knew but you didn't so perk your ears up and listen studio is a system and you could say that i'm driven and now it's onto the next saga we drink the best lager i'll never try to win you over like your stepfather i'll do my own thing now and get respect after and i'm avoiding the 'caine like it was get carter for four years i never had a place to stay but it's safe to say that it kept me grounded like a paperweight at 6 years old yeah i moved out of my home i was macy gray i tried to say goodbye and i choked and went from sleeping at a subway station to sleeping with a movie star and adding to the population not my imagination i don't wanna relax would it hurt your reputation if i put it on wax i'll take it back now  hook mmm come on and take it back love come on and take it back for us don't you fade into the back love no   i take it back with the rhythm and blues with my rap pack i'll be singing the news tryna act like jack black when i bring it to school i'll make a beat with my feet by just hitting a loop bringing the lyrics to prove that i can fit in these shoes i'll give you the truth through the vocal booth and stars burst out on the scene like an opal fruit they try to take aim like beckham when he goes to shoot but then again that's what they're supposed to do and i'm supposed to be calm i tattooed the lyrics onto my arm whispering everything that happens is from now on i'll be ready to start again by the end of the song and still they're claiming that i handle it wrong but then i've never had an enemy except the nme but i'll be selling twice as many copies as their magazines'll ever be with only spectacles ahead of me and festival fees are healthier than a dalmatian on pedigree singing for the masses rubber dinghy rapids i keep this rapping a habit and keep on fashioning magic i'm battling for respect and i don't know if i'll have it this song's from the heart covered the planet i'll take it back now  hook mmm come on and take it back love come on and take it back for us don't you fade into the back love no i'll take it back now   now i don't ever wanna be perfect 'cause i'm a singer that you never wanna see shirtless and i accept the fact that someone's gotta win worstdressed taking my first steps into the scene giving me focus putting on a brave face like timothy dalton considering a name change thinking it was hopeless rhyming over recordings avoiding tradition 'cause every day some lyrics and a melody could be written now absence can make your heart ache but drinking absinthe can change your mind state vividly need to let my liver be and i'll say it again living life on the edge with a closed handful of friends it's good advice from the man who took his life on the road with me and i hope to see him blowing up globally 'cause that's how it's supposed to be i'm screaming out vocally it might seem totally impossible achieving life's dreams but but i just write schemes i'm never having a stylist giving me tight jeans madison square garden is where i might be but more likely you'll find me in the back room of a dive bar with my mates having a pint with mcdaid discussing records we made and every single second knowing that we'll never betray the way we were raised remembering our background sat down that's how we plan it out it's time to take it back now  hook mmm come on and take it back love come on and take it back for us don't you fade into the back love no mmm come on and take it back love come on and take it back for us don't you fade into the back love no  4 my dreams keep me awake at night written in rhyme till i deliver the hype am i just living a lie with this you must know that the numbers just sold will keep me going through the tough times dream with me we forget 90 percent of it when we wake but the other 0 percent it never fades dreaming dreams of daytoday goals stay awake loads tried to make the cut like the paper with a razor blade oh never give up just remember just to hold out more a couple years ago i couldn't just control that thought you'd find me busking on the street when it was cold outdoors now i'm sweating on the stage of a soldout tour writing love songs for the sake of it never to make a hit you can't fake talent and work ethic just to make it quick i'm not a rapper i'm a singer i just take the piss and most of these other guys are kids that pose his little sister has to babysit that's just the way it is dreams are your own just set your goals and have the upmost faith in it tread your own path you'll never make it as a follower you'll never know

sayin' i no longer got it 'cause you missed a line and never caught it 'cause it went over your head because you're too stupid to get it 'cause you're mentally retarded but pretend to be the smartest with your expertise and knowledge but you'll never be an artist and i'm harder on myself than you could ever be regardless what i'll never be is flawless all i'll ever be is honest illa illa illa even when i'm gone they're gonna say i brought it even when i hit my forties like a fuckin' alcoholic with a bottle full of malt liquor but i couldn't bottle this shit any longer the fact that i know that i'ma hit my bottom if i don't pull myself from the jaws of defeat and rise to my feet i don't see why y'all even started with me i get in beefs my enemies die i don't cease fire 'til at least all are deceased i'm east side never be caught slippin' now you see why i don't sleep not even a wink i don't blink i don't doze off i don't even nod to the beats i don't even close my fuckin' eyes when i

yeah invite 'em in like a one a day i'm not done preach 'cause i feel like the beast of burden that line in the sand was it even worth it 'cause the way i see people turning's makin' it seem worthless it's startin' to defeat the purpose i'm watchin' my fan base shrink to thirds and i was just tryin' to do the right thing but word has the court of public opinion reached a verdict or still yet to be determined 'cause i'm determined to be me critiqued or worshipped but if i could go back i'd at least reword it and say i empathize with the people this evil serpent sold the dream to that he's deserted but i think it's workin' these verses are makin' him a wee bit nervous and he's too scurred to answer me with words 'cause he knows that he will lyrically get murdered but i know at least he's heard it 'cause agent orange just sent the secret service to meet in person to see if i really think of hurtin' him or ask if i'm linked to terrorists i said only when it comes to ink and lyricists but my beef is more media journalists hold up hold up hold up i said my beef is more meaty a journalist can get a mouthful of flesh and yes i mean eating a penis 'cause they've been pannin' my album to death so i've been givin' the media fingers don't wanna turn this to a counseling sesh but they've been puttin' me through the ringer so i ain't ironin' shit out with the press but i just

anyone on the receiving end of those jokes you offend i'm the nightmare you fell asleep and then woke up still in i'm your karma closing in with each stroke of a pen perfect time to have some remorse to show for your sin nope it's hopeless i'm the denial that you're hopelessly in when they say all of this is approaching its end but you refuse to believe that it's over here we go all over again back's to the wall i'm stacking up all them odds toilets clogged yeah cause i'm talking a lot of shit but i'm backing it all up but in my head there's a voice in the back and it hollers after the track is demolished i am your lack of a conscience i'm the ringing in your ears i'm the polyps on the back of your tonsils eating your vocal cords after your concerts i'm your time that's almost up that you haven't acknowledged grab for some water but i'm that pill that's too jagged to swallow i'm the bullies you hate that you became with every faggot you slaughtered coming back on ya every woman you insult batter but the doublestandard you have when it comes to your daughters i represent everything you take for granted cause marshall mathers the rapper's persona is half a facade and matthew and stan's just symbolic of you not knowing what you had 'til it's gone cause after all the glitz and the glam no more fans that are calling your name cameras are off sad but it happens to all of them i'm the hindsight to say i told you so foreshadows of all the things that are to follow i'm the future that's here to show you what happens tomorrow if you don't stop after they call ya

to say 'less it makes an impact then don't bother so 'fore you rest your case better make sure you're packing a wallop so one last time i'm back 'fore it fades into black and it's all over behold the final chapter in a saga tryna recapture that lightning trapped in a bottle twice the magic that started it all tragic portrait of an artist tortured trapped in his own drawings tap into thoughts

zombie floatin' but i got your mom deepthroatin' i'm out my ramen noodle we have nothin' in common poodle i'm a doberman pinch yourself in the arm and pay homage pupil it's me my honesty's brutal but it's honestly futile if i don't utilize what i do though for good at least once in a while so i wanna make sure somewhere in this chicken scratch i scribble and doodle enough rhymes to maybe try to help get some people through tough times but i gotta keep a few punchlines just in case 'cause even you unsigned rappers are hungry lookin' at me like it's lunchtime i know there was a time where once i was king of the underground but i still rap like i'm on my pharoahe monch grind so i crunch rhymes but sometimes when you combine appeal with the skin color of mine you get too big and here they come tryin' to censor you like that one line i said on i'm back from the mathers lp  when i tried to say i'll take seven kids from columbine put 'em all in a line add an ak47 a revolver and a 9 see if i get away with it now that i ain't as big as i was but i'm morphin' into an immortal comin' through the portal you're stuck in a time warp from 004 though and i don't know what the fuck that you rhyme for you're pointless as rapunzel with fuckin' cornrows you write normal fuck being normal and i just bought a new raygun from the future just to come and shoot ya like when fabolous made ray j mad 'cause fab said he looked like a fag at mayweather's pad singin' to a man while he played piano man oh man that was a 47 special on the cable channel so ray j went straight to the radio station

innovative and i'm made of rubber so that anything you say is ricochetin' off of me and it'll glue to you and i'm devastating more than ever demonstrating how to give a motherfuckin' audience a feeling like it's levitating never fading and i know the haters are forever waiting for the day that they can say i fell off they'll be celebrating 'cause i know the way to get 'em motivated i make elevating music you make elevator music oh he's too mainstream well that's what they do when they get jealous they confuse it it's not hiphop it's pop'cause i found a hella way to fuse it with rock shock rap with doc throw on lose yourself and make 'em lose it i don't know how to make songs like that i don't know what words to use let me know when it occurs to you while i'm rippin' any one of these verses that versus you it's curtains i'm inadvertently hurtin' you how many verses i gotta murder to prove that if you were half as nice your songs you could sacrifice virgins too ugh school flunky pill junkie but look at the accolades these skills brung me full of myself but still hungry i bully myself 'cause i make me do what i put my mind to and i'm a million leagues above you ill when i speak in tongues but it's still tongueincheek fuck you i'm drunk so satan take the fucking wheel i'ma sleep in the front seat bumpin' heavy d and the boyz still chunky but funky but in my head there's something i can feel tugging and struggling angels fight with devils and here's what they want from me they're askin' me to eliminate some of the women hate but if you take into consideration the bitter hatred i have then you may be a little patient and more sympathetic to the situation and understand the discrimination but fuck it life's handin' you lemons make lemonade then but if i can't batter the women how the fuck am i supposed to bake them a cake then don't mistake him for satan it's a fatal mistake if you think i need to be overseas and take a vacation to trip a broad and

was like we're putting that outlaughing  tim mcgraw well i'm glad ya did 'cause um it's doing well for ya  radio dj so i so i understand that you two guys have not talked  tim mcgraw no  radio dj you haven't met  tim mcgraw no  taylor swift no we've never talked or met or anything  tim mcgraw i sent her a message one time i think with entertainment weekly or something like that oh i don't remember what show it was i was doing an interview and they were going to interview taylor the next day so i sent her a little message so i don't know if she got it or not  taylor swift oh my god they never gave that to me  tim mcgraw they didn't okay well there ya go i did laughing  radio dj so ii  taylor swift we've just officially never never talked or messaged or anything  tim mcgraw not at all  radio dj so i thought i think it's pretty brave to put out a song called tim mcgraw without maybe talking to tim mcgraw did you mind  taylor swift it was definitely kind of a chance ya know i didn't say anything bad in the song so i was kinda thinking ya know he wouldn't take it too bad  tim mcgraw well thank you for that thank you for not saying anything bad i'm sure there's plenty that could've been said tell me  taylor swift could you tell faith that i said hello  tim mcgraw i sure will i sure will and she loves the song too by the way  taylor swift oh my gosh she's awesome  tim mcgraw i agree  radio dj this thistell me about writing a song um did this did this really happen  taylor swift well yeah i mean i never really kinda went into this writing session on i'm gonna write a song called tim mcgraw um yeah because that would just be weird but um laughing i actually this this is kinda strange but i actually came up with the melody and ideas for this song in math class in my freshman year of high school  tim mcgraw now i feel old  taylor swift and um i was sitting there and was kind of started singing it to myself and i was going through a period where i was dating this guy that was going off to college and i knew we were gonna break up so i started to think about all the things that i knew would remind him of me and it's kinda like a given one of all my friends ya know that my favorite songs are tim mcgraw songs they just are  tim mcgraw aww thank you  taylor swift and uh you know so i kinda just thought about that first and so it pointed to the song and just sat down at that piano and wrote it with this cowriter who was kinda wondering if i was crazy or not but it turned out alright and ya know the funny thing is that i shelved this song for like three months and never never even played it for anybody never even demoed it and uh then one time i was just goofing around and played it for my record label president and he goes well that's your first single laughing  taylor swift and i'm like well  tim mcgraw well you can write songs about me anytime taylor laughing  taylor swift that's awesome there's a part two coming out next month  tim mcgraw

Taylor Swift,Rare Peer (Brenda Lee Tribute),Woman Walk The Line ,2017-09-20,i'm curled up in my mother's bed staring intently at my laptop i'm watching a video of a familiarlooking man wearing a black tuxedo the video seems to be of a televised award show the tape is grainy but the man steps up to the mic and his words are clear  now i'm gonna deal you a queen from the winning hand her voice is full like solid gold with some platinum blended in sometimes you'll hear silver when she twists and twirls her notes but gold is brenda's metal in this song i wish i'd wrote ladies and gentlemen brenda lee  the camera then focuses on a woman in her late thirties the music starts and she's looking down at a framed picture she's at ease she is theatrical and she is beautiful in a sparkling gown that matches the twinkle in her eye lights camera action she starts to sing that's when you hear the gold and you watch her as she holds the crowd in the palm of her hand the performance ends and the crowd goes wild the lovely lady graciously takes a bow she smiles out into the vast darkness taking it all in with grace and composure the video ends and i reflect back on what i just saw it was a timeless performance but here are the facts the year is 98 the song is someone loves you honey the man in the tuxedo is johnny cash and the woman in the beautiful dress with the honeylike voice is none other than brenda lee  brenda lee who was born in 944 near atlanta and used her prodigious singing talent to support her family after the tragic death of her father brenda lee the little girl who took over the music world with charttopping hits when she was still a child brenda lee the woman who ushered in a new style of rock  roll and was one of the early musical artists to find her fame through television brenda lee the artist who later went back to her country roots proving that she could create classics and break down barriers no matter what genre or category her music fell under brenda lee the singer who mastered the sound of heartbreak so flawlessly that she made audiences not only identify with her but believe her  i watch the look on her face as she ends her song and first hears that applause there's a reason she's been able to move people to their feet for almost sixty years brenda lee is grace brenda lee is class and composure and when she hears the roar of a crowd brenda lee smiles like she's five years old and receiving her first standing ovation brenda lee is someone i will always look up to because of the way she shines as johnny cash said in 98 it's almost like she's golden,0.998,0.032,0.791,0.178,Positive
